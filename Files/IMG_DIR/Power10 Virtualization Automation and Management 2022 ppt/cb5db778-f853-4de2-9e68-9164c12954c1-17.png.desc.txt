The image is a slide from a presentation about IBM Power Shared Utility Capacity, which explains how it works and what servers can be deployed with it. The slide is divided into three main sections: "How it works," "Which servers?" and "IBM Cloud Management Console with HMC."

### How it works:
- **Purchase servers with Base capacity:** This section explains that customers can purchase servers with base capacity.
- **Variable demand addressed by buying Capacity Credits for Metered capacity:** It mentions that variable demand can be addressed by purchasing Capacity Credits for Metered capacity.

### Which servers?
- **Deploy across a pool of Power9 or Power10 systems:** This section indicates that the servers can be deployed across a pool of Power9 or Power10 systems.

### Additional Information:
- **Pool #1** is highlighted in blue, indicating that it is the Metered capacity.
- **System A** and **System B** are shown on the left side, with System C being part of the Pool #1.
- **System A** and **System B** have a mix of Base and Metered capacity.
- **System C** is entirely in the Metered capacity pool.
- **IBM Cloud Management Console with HMC automatically monitors and debits against Capacity Credits for actual resource usage by the minute.**

### Visual Elements:
- The background features an image of a building with a blue sky, possibly representing IBM's headquarters or a related infrastructure.
