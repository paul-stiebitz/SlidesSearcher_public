This image is a slide from a presentation that explains how PowerVM delivers virtualization benefits. The slide is titled "How PowerVM delivers virtualization benefits." It outlines the steps to deploy a virtualized workload with PowerVM and lists several benefits of using PowerVM for virtualizing workloads.

### Steps to Deploy a Virtualized Workload with PowerVM:
1. **Create a new PowerVM virtual machine (VM).**
2. **Install the operating system (AIX, IBM i or Linux) in the VM.**
3. **Install the workload application(s) in the VM.**
4. **Configure the operating system and applications as required.**

### Benefits of Virtualizing Workloads with PowerVM:
- **Extreme consolidation:** Many diverse workloads can be hosted on one server.
- **Rapid provisioning:** Deploying a ready-to-run workload is quick and easy.
- **High scalability:** Deploying multiple copies of a workload type is simplified.
- **Easy recoverability:** Restoring a workload after an outage is fast and reliable.
