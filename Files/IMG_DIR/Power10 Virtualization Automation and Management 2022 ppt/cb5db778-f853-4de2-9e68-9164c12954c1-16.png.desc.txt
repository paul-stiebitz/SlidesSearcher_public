   - **Details**: It mentions being able to see basic health and state information for these systems.

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - **Description**: This section focuses on aggregated performance across the Power enterprise.
   - **Details**: It includes energy monitoring and OS metrics.

3. **Log Trends**:
   - **Description**: This section highlights log aggregation and telemetry capabilities.
   - **Details**: It mentions the ability to aggregate logs and monitor trends.

4. **Patch Planning**:
