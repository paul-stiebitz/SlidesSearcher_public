   - Secure accelerated LPM between Power9/10 servers.

2. **Active Memory Mirroring (AMM)**:
   - With the FW1020 firmware release, AMM is now supported across all Power10 models, including scale-out servers (previously AMM was limited to high-end and midrange servers).

### Right Side:
1. **Common Criteria (CC) EAL 2**:
   - As the focus on cybersecurity continues to intensify, PowerVM and VIOS will receive this globally-recognized security certification at the EAL 2 level.
   - This certification provides customers with confidence in the security of the Power10 infrastructure.

The slide highlights the advancements in PowerVM, particularly in terms of LPM and AMM, and mentions the upcoming EAL 2 certification, which is a significant step in enhancing the security of the Power10 infrastructure.
